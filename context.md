Thinkr is the AI platform powering autonomous ecommerce operations.

It connects your entire ecommerce stack—Shopify, Meta Ads, Google Ads, Klaviyo, and more—into one intelligent system that monitors performance, flags issues, and executes growth actions for you. With Thinkr, you no longer need to juggle platforms, interpret fragmented data, or manually fix what’s broken. AI agents handle the complexity behind the scenes, so you can focus on strategy and scale.

Thinkr’s agents continuously analyze real-time data across your store and marketing channels to detect drops in performance, missed opportunities, or operational risks. When action is needed, you get clear, personalized suggestions—like launching a targeted promotion, rebalancing ad spend, or fixing a pricing mismatch. Approve with one click, and Thinkr executes automatically through its Autopilot system.

At the heart of the platform is an AI chat interface that brings everything together. It understands your goals, interprets cross-platform data, and gives instant, contextual answers. Whether you’re diagnosing why ROAS dropped last week or exploring how to raise average order value, you can ask Thinkr and get a human-like response backed by 300+ integrations and proprietary insights.

For teams managing multiple stores or fast-growing brands, Thinkr becomes the virtual operations team—running 24/7, spotting risks, sending alerts, and taking action before problems cost you money. It replaces manual work, endless dashboards, and siloed reports with a proactive, centralized system that drives growth intelligently.
